          Samuel Shafiishuna Daniel Nujoma,[1] (/nuːˈjoʊmə/; born 12 May 1929)
          is a Namibian revolutionary, anti-apartheid activist and politician
          who served three terms as the first President of Namibia, from 1990 to
          2005. Nujoma was a founding member and the first president of the
          South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in 1960. Prior to
          1960, SWAPO was known as the Ovambo People's Organisation (OPO). He
          played an important role as leader of the national liberation movement
          in campaigning for Namibia's political independence from South African
          rule. He established the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in
          1962 and launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government of
          South Africa in August 1966 at Omugulugwombashe, beginning after the
          United Nations withdrew the mandate for South Africa to govern the
          territory. Nujoma led SWAPO during the lengthy Namibian War of
          Independence, which lasted from 1966 to 1989.
